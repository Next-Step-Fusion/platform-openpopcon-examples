## 🌐 Overview
The **Fusion Twin Platform** (https://fusiontwin.io) is a cloud-based platform for running **highly customizable tokamak simulations**, uploading and visualizing fusion data, collaborating and sharing with others, and more. To run realistic simulations, the Fusion Twin Platform uses **digital replicas** of tokamaks such as DIII-D, ISTTOK, SMART, and NSF NTT.

More digital replicas are coming soon.
